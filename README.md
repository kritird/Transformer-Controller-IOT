# Transformer-Controller-IOT
The application is a transformer data logger and controller used for transformer testing. The application is build on python3 and Arduino. It monitors upto 5 transformers and controls the Transformers Voltage &amp; Current. Any time the transformers reach over Voltage or under Current situation, the power supplies are automatically turned off. As a part of enhancement, the python modules can be updated to transmit the data to a remote host for IOT functionality. The code is platform independent. All the code are taken from open source forums.
